        <h2>Seafoam (verse 1)</h2>
        <p>
          There's a port on a western bay <br />
          And it serves a hundred ships a day <br />
          Lonely sailors pass the time away <br />
          And talk about their homes
        </p>

        <p>
          And there's a girl in this harbor town <br />
          And she works layin' whiskey down <br />
          They say, Brandy, fetch another round <br />
          She serves them whiskey and wine 
        </p>

        <p>
          Brandy wears a braided chain <br />
          Made of finest silver from the North of Spain <br />
          A locket that bears the name <br />
          Of the man that Brandy loved 
        </p>

        <p>
          He came on a summer's day <br />
          Bringin' gifts from far away <br />
          But he made it clear he couldn't stay <br />
          No harbor was his home

        <p>
          Yeah Brandy used to watch his eyes <br />
          When he told the sailor's story <br />
          She could feel the ocean fall and rise <br />
          She saw it's ragin' glory 
        </p>

        <p>
          But he had always told the truth <br />
          Lord he was an honest man <br />
          Brandy does her best to understand <br />
          (tu tu tu tuu tu tu tuu tu tu tuu tuu!)

        <p>
          At night when the bars close down <br />
          Brandy walks through a silent town <br />
          And loves a man who's not around <br />
          She still can hear him sing
        </p>

        <p>
          She hear's him, "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl) <br />
          "What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl) <br />
          "But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea" <br />
